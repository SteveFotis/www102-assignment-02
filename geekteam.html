              Whether you're experiencing problems with your computer, printer or
              network, we're here to help. Our Techsperts are certified in the
              repair of computer hardware, software and peripherals, and in the

            </p>
            <h3>Viruses, spyware, adware & pop-ups</h3>
            <p>
              On a daily basis we see systems that are infected with viruses,
              trojans and spyware &mdash; there have never been so many malicious
              pieces of software around!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a correctly configured system which receives regular
              updates and security patches then you're better protected from these
              common threats. We can help to stop these threats as well as offering
              you some safer surfing tips.
            </p>
            <h3>Troublesome software</h3>
            <p>
              In the majority of cases a computer problem turns out to be software
              related. These problems are often caused when unfriendly software is
              installed then removed. They can also be caused by incompatible
              drivers or software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to the complexity of operating systems, the companies who develop
              them release regular updates to fix errors and potential security
              vulnerabilities in the original software. It's important to be using a
              correctly confugured device that receives regular updates.
            </p>
            <h3>Troublesome hardware</h3>
            <p>
              Some components wear out with use over time and simply need to be
              replaced. Any peripheral devices such as printers and scanners can
              fail to work correctly for many reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use industy approved techniques to diagnose, troubleshoot and
              remedy problems. If a part needs to be replaced, we'll advise on what
              we believe to be the most suitable options. In most cases we can fix
              or source and install an alternative component.
            </p>
            <h3>Improved performance & reliability</h3>
            <p>
              Technology is advancing at an alarming rate, and it's possible that
              the top of the range PC purchased 1 year ago is struggling to do what
              you want it to.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is, you don't have to buy a new one to benefit from the
              latest technology. It's often a simple case of upgrading some of the
              internal components.
            </p>
            <p>
              We offer a full upgrade service to best suite your needs and pocket.
